# logistic_regression_scratch

Multiclass classification based on hazelnuts variety "c_avellana, c_americana,c_corutana" implementing with Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch in Python. 

Dataset description: The dataset describes hazelnuts, the attributes are in rows in the following order: sample_id, length, width, thickness, surface_area, mass, compactness, hardness, shell_top_radius, water_content, carbohydrate_content, variety.

The goal is to predict variety (which may be one of three classes: c_americana, c_cornuta or c_avellana) based on the other attributes.
